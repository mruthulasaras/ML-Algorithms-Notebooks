**Machine Learning Algorithms**

This repository contains beginner-friendly Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the implementation of essential machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques using Python. It is part of my learning journey in data science and machine learning.

**Contents**

✅Simple Linear Regressin.ipynb:	Implements simple linear regression for predicting a continuous variable from one feature.

✅Polynomial Regression.ipynb:	Shows how to model non-linear relationships using polynomial features.

✅One Hot Encoding.ipynb:	Demonstrates categorical variable encoding using one-hot encoding.

✅Multilinear Regression.ipynb:	Applies multiple linear regression using multiple independent variables.

✅Logistic Regression.ipynb:	Classification algorithm used for binary outcomes (e.g., yes/no, 0/1).

✅XGBOOST.ipynb:	Advanced ensemble technique (Gradient Boosting) for powerful predictive modeling.

✅DECISION TREE.ipynb:	Decision tree classifier for modeling decision rules and outcomes.
